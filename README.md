General Idea: Elections and politics hold significant importance as they greatly impact people's lives. However, individuals are often preoccupied with their own daily affairs, leaving little time to browse numerous websites, conduct thorough research, and make well-informed decisions regarding their votes. While there exist various websites offering polling, forecasts, and election results, there is a noticeable lack of platforms that provide comprehensive coverage of candidates, their positions, and relevant news pertaining to specific races. My website is a comprehensive election data website that allows users to create accounts, log in/out, view their profiles, compare presidential candidates, access election results for the country and states/counties through an interactive map, and customize their news feed based on their stances and preferred candidates. The website also employs an algorithm that uses user data, including stances, party preferences, followed candidates, and candidate interactions, to recommend the most compatible candidates for users to follow.
